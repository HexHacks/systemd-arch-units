# Note that this is the service file for running a single SSH server for all
# incoming connections, suitable only for systems with a large amount of SSH
# traffic. In almost all other cases it is a better idea to use sshd.socket +
# sshd@.service (i.e. the on-demand spawning version for one instance per
# connection).
